        <h1>let / const variable declarations</h1>
        <p>1. when let & const are declared on a global level,
            the variables are not stored as properties of <br>
            gloabl window object. But, they still act as global objects.<br>
            2. let & const are function and block scope variable declarations.<br>
            3. Parts of const can be manipulated when used as an object.<br>
            4. When let & const are run in console b4 being declared,<br>
            the value of variable becomes undefined. While it works for
             <b>"var"</b>.<br>
            5. let & var variables can be redeclared while consts' cannot.<br>
            6. Let variable without a value will be undefined while const variables
            syntax error is given.
